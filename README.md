This repository is dedicated to personal data analysis and machine learning projects.
I will be adding to this periodically to exhibit the skills and interests I have gained in the field.
All coding is done through Python and several libraries including Pandas, numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit Learn.
