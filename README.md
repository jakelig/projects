This repository is dedicated to personal data analysis and machine learning projects.
I will be adding periodically and hope to cover several different topics such as
data scraping, regression and classification models, and visualization.

## Fantasy and Homefield Advantage
As a big fantasy football player, I was interested in finding if homefield advantage
had any impact on fantasy outcomes. I was also looking for better ways to collect
fantasy data, as most of is inaccessible or requires a paywall. I took this as an opportunity
to hone my data scraping skills.

In this notebook, I scrape some fantasy data from Pro Football Reference and use it
to determine if players - and what positions of players - are sensitive to homefield
in fantasy football. I also take a look at what may be the cause of some of the differences,
and what it means for making fantasy decisions.
